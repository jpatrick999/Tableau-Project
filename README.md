# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The primary objective of this project is to showcase proficiency data analytic skills, including unravelling nuanced trends / correlations and visualization. In completing this Tableau Project, I utilized datasets sourced from the Canadian Open Data portal, encompassing weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, and various indices to provide a comprehensive understanding of & visual insights into the ever-evolving Canadian real estate ecosystem particularly in the context of economic crises and market fluctuations.

## Process
Data Collection Datasets for this project was sourced from the Canadian Open Data portal, encompassing weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, and economic indices. The data spans multiple decades, offering a comprehensive view of the Canadian real estate landscape.

Data Cleaning and Preparation Data cleaning processes were employed to ensure accuracy and consistency including handling missing values, standardizing formats, and validating data. Inconsistencies and outliers were identified and addressed to prevent skewing of results.

Tableau Integration and Interactive Dashboards Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, was employed for its versatility and user-friendly interface. The cleaned datasets were imported into Tableau, relationships between variables were established, Custom calculations and aggregations were performed to derive meaningful insights, and various visualization types were utilized to effectively communicate trends, comparisons, and correlations within the datasets. Created interactive dashboards in Tableau, incorporated filters, parameters, and tooltips to enhance user interactivity and provided an intuitive and informative visual representation of the Canadian real estate dynamics in Canada.


## Results
Option 1

Key Findings & Trends:

• House Price Index Ascendancy: The House Price Index consistently showed an upward trend from 2001 to 2022, indicating sustained growth in the real estate market.

• Earnings Growth: Average weekly earnings, inclusive of overtime, also exhibited a positive trajectory over the years, revealing an increase in income levels.

• Relative Disparity: While both house prices and earnings increased, there is a noticeable gap in the growth rates, with house prices outpacing the rise in average weekly earnings.

• Affordability Challenge: The growing disparity between house prices and earnings suggests potential challenges for individuals aspiring to enter the housing market. This could impact overall affordability and access to homeownership.

• Market Dynamics: The insights underscore the importance of monitoring and managing the dynamics between housing prices and earnings to promote a sustainable and inclusive real estate market.

Visualisations:

• Created a time series line chart to show the trend of house prices over the last 40 years.

• Utilized a line chart to compare the trends of house and office prices, highlighting the rate of increase.

• Generated a heatmap to visually represent current house prices across different districts in Canada.

• Employed a bar chart to compare the trends of earnings and house prices over time.

• Created a bar chart to compare the percentage of earnings spent in 2014 and 2001.

• Developed multiple line charts to illustrate the impact of four economic crises on various indicators.

• Plotted a scatter plot with a regression line to explore the relationship between the consumer index and house prices.

## Challenges 

•Deciding on the most effective visualization to appropriately pass across “the message” to key stakeholders.

•Ensuring consistency in units and timeframes across different datasets.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

• Refine visualizations for enhanced clarity and aesthetics.

• Conduct further analysis to uncover additional insights.

• Consider additional external factors that might have contributed to the trends observed in the data.
